	abstract = {The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems presents significant impacts on distribution network (DN) operations. To this end, an accurate evaluation of PV hosting capacity (PVHC) can help utilities to carry out PV capacity planning and configuration more effectively, ensuring the efficiency, economy, and reliability of DNs. First, the definition of interval overvoltage probability (IOP) is introduced and the IOP based PVHC evaluation method is presented. Next, this method is improved considering PV and load uncertainties, where the interval arithmetic (IA) and affine arithmetic (AA) are both applied to deal with uncertainties. In addition, the overvoltage severity is taken into account on the basis of IOP, and the concept of interval overvoltage risk (IOR) is proposed. A practical 55-bus rural feeder in China is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method compared with the conventional method, and also to verify the value in decision-making of PV planning for utilities. Moreover, the sensitivity of interval valued PVHC against the number of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and width of PV installation capacity interval (PICI) is analyzed. And the impacts of on-load tap changer (OLTC) tap positions and static var compensator (SVC) configurations are also explored. Finally, the proposed method is tested on the NYSEG 292-bus system to validate its adaptability on a larger and unbalanced system.},

	abstract = {A high penetration of residential photovoltaic (PV) panels can potentially cause a number of operational issues in the distribution circuit, necessitating the requirement to determine the largest PV generation, a distribution circuit can accommodate. This paper presents a Monte Carlo-based hourly stochastic analysis framework to determine a circuit's PV accommodation limit or PV hosting capacity. First, a mathematical formulation of the hosting capacity problem for bus overvoltage concerns is presented, followed by the proposed analysis approach. In the proposed approach, the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the scenarios of probable PV locations and sizes while the hourly analysis framework is used to include the daily variations in load and PV generation. Next, a method to evaluate the percentage accuracy of the hosting capacity results is presented. The sensitivity of PV hosting results to multiple parameters related to both feeder characteristics and simulation method are evaluated as well. The utility of the proposed framework is presented using an actual 12.47-kV distribution circuit. In sum, by presenting a PV hosting analysis method, accuracy assessment framework, and sensitivity analysis approach, this paper provides a thorough understanding of the PV hosting capacity problem.},

Previous researches have mainly utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that need dramatic computational efforts and may lead to local-optima. Through an extensive circuit analysis new terms called “Diff and Pivot” are proposed based on analytical formulations. The diff value represents the difference between the maximum loss reduction caused by a DG placed at a bus and the previous bus. Pivot relates diff values at every two successive branches. An algorithm named Pivot for Simultaneous Reconfiguration and DG Hosting (PSRH) is developed. For verification, PSRH is applied to IEEE-33, IEEE-69, and practical 84-bus RDNs and results are compared to AI techniques. Deduced outcomes are very encouraging with fewer computational steps. Moreover, the compromised solution of PSRH is superior when considering the outages of DGs as PV modules at night.},

	abstract = {We present a simulation and multi-objective optimization framework for the integration of renewable generators and storage devices into an electrical distribution network. The framework searches for the optimal size and location of the distributed renewable generation units (DG). Uncertainties in renewable resources availability, components failure and repair events, loads and grid power supply are incorporated. A Monte Carlo simulation - optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational model is used to generate scenarios of the uncertain variables and evaluate the network electric performance. As a response to the need of monitoring and controlling the risk associated to the performance of the optimal DG-integrated network, we introduce the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure into the framework. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is done with respect to the minimization of the expectations of the global cost (C g) and energy not supplied (ENS) combined with their respective CVaR values. The multi-objective optimization is performed by the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II. For exemplification, the framework is applied to a distribution network derived from the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder. The results show that the MOO MCS-OPF framework is effective in finding an optimal DG-integrated network considering multiple sources of uncertainties. In addition, from the perspective of decision making, introducing the CVaR as a measure of risk enables the evaluation of trade-offs between optimal expected performances and risks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, a GA (genetic algorithm) optimization approach is employed to search optimal sizes of four design options for a net zero energy building. Then, sensitivity analysis is conducted on an optimized system (photovoltaic/wind turbine/bio-diesel generator) to investigate the impacts of the design input variations on the building performance (i.e. operation cost, CO2 emission, impact on grid). The results show that, with 20\% variations in the four variables, the maximum change of the combined objective is 26.2\%. In addition, wind velocity is the key factor concerning mismatch ratio, the cost and CDE (CO2 emissions), while the building loads should be considered with high priority concerning the comprehensive performance (combined objective) of the building. The performance of the energy system, integrating photovoltaic and bio-diesel generator, is not the best. But, compared with the other three design options, the variations of operation variables have least effects on its performance (i.e. most robust performance). The results also provide the quantitative assessment on the impact of active energy generation systems on enhancing the performance robustness of net zero energy buildings.},

In this paper, a simplified analytical approach is presented which allows the voltage rise possibility to be tested and the performance of its mitigation techniques to be evaluated. Equivalent transformations are used to represent complicated power systems using simplified circuits. Then, formulas are derived to determine the PV power limits beyond which a voltage rise will be encountered considering the PV sources capability of absorbing reactive power. Moreover, the system losses in each case are estimated using the proposed formulas. Consequently, the proposed analysis method could be used for a number of applications related to PV sizing and losses minimization. The validity of the proposed method is verified through a number of case studies where its findings are compared with results obtained from DIgSILENT software tools.},

	abstract = {This report examines how the bulk power system may need to evolve to accommodate the increased photovoltaic (PV) penetration resulting from achievement of the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot cost targets. The variable and uncertain nature of PV-generated electricity presents grid-integration challenges. For example, the changing net load associated with high midday PV generation and low electricity demand can create “overgeneration” that requires curtailment of PV output and reduces PV's value and cost-competitiveness. Accommodating the changes in net load resulting from increased variable generation requires enhancements to a power system's “flexibility,” or ability to balance supply and demand over multiple time scales through options including changes in system operation, flexible generation, reserves from solar, demand response, energy storage, and enhanced transmission and regional coordination. For utility-scale PV with a baseline SunShot levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 6¢/kWh, increasing the annual energy demand met by solar energy from 10\% to 20\% would increase the marginal LCOE of PV from 6¢/kWh to almost 11¢/kWh in a California grid system with limited flexibility. However, increasing system flexibility could minimize solar curtailment and keep PV cost-competitive at penetrations at least as high as 25\%. In the longer term, energy storage technologies—such as concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage—could facilitate the cost-effective integration of even higher PV penetration. Efficient deployment of the grid-flexibility options needed to maintain solar's value will require various innovations, from the development of communication, control, and energy storage technologies to the implementation of new market rules and operating procedures.},

	abstract = {The growth of smart power grids has complicated the balancing of supply and demand, the control and management of power outages, and the reduction of grid costs. In order to strengthen power grid reliability and reduce the risk of failure in production resources, demand-side management has gained particular importance. Microgrids are dramatically expanding due to the potential benefits of an increasingly reliable, sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly energy supply from renewable energy sources. In recent years, the air pollution crisis has attracted much attention. Among the factors that aggravate this crisis, pollution from fossil fuels has been playing a significantly greater role. As a result, the trend toward renewable energies, such as solar power, has grown considerably. As a gradually introduced alternative to fossil fuels, solar energy presents many benefits as well as numerous challenges. One of the most critical issues is the unreliability of this energy source. The management solution is to define an appropriate model for predicting how solar energy works and how to accordingly manage its storage. This paper proposes a solar generation model based on the Markov Chain, by which the formation of a cluster of chains predicts the power generation of solar cells. In order to reduce the prediction error, Markov chains are continuously trained by historical data. Evaluation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that in order to solve a probabilistic load flow in radial distribution networks, it is necessary to apply effective techniques that take into account their technical constraints. Among these constraints, voltage regulation is one of the principal problems to be addressed in photovoltaic distributed generation. Probabilistic load flows can be solved by analytical techniques as well as the Monte Carlo method. Our research study applied an analytical method that combined the cumulant method with the Cornish-Fisher expansion to solve this problem. The Monte Carlo method is used to compare the results of analytical method proposed. To evaluate the performance of photovoltaic distributed generation, this paper describes a probabilistic model that takes into account the random nature of solar irradiance. Therefore, load and photovoltaic distributed generation are modelled as independent/dependent random variables. The results obtained show that the technique proposed gave a better performance than the Monte Carlo method. This technique provided satisfactory solutions with a smaller number of iterations. Therefore, convergence was rapidly attained and computational cost was lower than that required for the Monte Carlo method. Besides, the results revealed how the Cornish-Fisher expansion had a better performance than the Gram-Charlier expansion, when input random variables were non-Gaussian. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder.},

Battery storage systems (BSSs) have been used in many studies to decrease the reverse power and improve the HC by controlling the active power. However, the influence of a central BSS on the HC can be greatly improved by using a quadratic power control, simultaneous active, and reactive power control, and by selecting of the optimal battery size, the converter size, and the place of the central BSS. The effectiveness of the quadratic power control was not seen in previous works due to the fact that grids with one level of voltage without modeling of MV/LV transformers were simulated. This paper develops a method to select the optimal size of the battery and converter unit as well as the optimal place of an LV-central BSS having an optimal quadratic power control.

Since accuracy is a necessity in determining the hosting capacity, an evaluation of the rooftop photovoltaic allocation strategies concerning its accuracy is required. Therefore, the objective of this work is to provide a study of rooftop photovoltaic allocation strategies evaluation of hosting capacity analysis in the low-voltage distribution grid. To consider the actual issues, a real low-voltage distribution grid from Indonesia is employed. Over/undervoltage and feeder operating power factor are assigned as the operational performance limits considered for determining the hosting capacity. This work begins with assessing six possible scenarios concerning rooftop photovoltaic distribution flow direction. The results show that the feeder operating power factor is observed as the most restrictive limit. These also indicate that several distinct locations must be considered to develop allocation strategies. According to these results, three LDCRPA (locational dependence constrained rooftop photovoltaic allocation) strategies are developed, including strategy with null locational dependence, two locational dependences, and three locational dependences. Furthermore, these strategies are employed to determine the rooftop photovoltaic hosting capacities, and the accuracy assessment is applied. The results show that, with a tolerance value of 0.09, the strategy considering two locational dependences generates the highest accuracy of 0.952381 compared with the other strategies.},

	abstract = {In rural areas or in isolated communities in developing countries it is increasingly common to install micro-renewable sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, by residential consumers without access to the utility distribution network. The reliability of the supply provided by these stand-alone generators is a key issue when designing the PV system. The proper system sizing for a minimum level of reliability avoids unacceptable continuity of supply (undersized system) and unnecessary costs (oversized system). This paper presents a method for the accurate sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic (SAPV) residential generation systems for a pre-established reliability level. The proposed method is based on the application of a sequential random Monte Carlo simulation to the system model. Uncertainties of solar radiation, energy demand, and component failures are simultaneously considered. The results of the case study facilitate the sizing of the main energy elements (solar panels and battery) depending on the required level of reliability, taking into account the uncertainties that affect this type of facility. The analysis carried out demonstrates that deterministic designs of SAPV systems based on average demand and radiation values or the average number of consecutive cloudy days can lead to inadequate levels of continuity of supply.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Networks Operators (NO) have experienced an increased number of requests for video contents and rich media services, which are becoming increasingly popular. In view of the network scaling limitations, operators are developing their own caching systems to speed up the network performance. Indeed, disseminating caches in the infrastructure not only helps in absorbing the network's congestion, but in addition, brings content closer to users, which allows a reduced latency. Several studies have focused on improving the performance of such caching systems, especially in the context of Content-Centric Networking (CCN). In this paper, we propose a fairly generic model of caching systems that can be adapted very easily to represent different caching strategies, even the most advanced ones. Indeed, the proposed model of a single cache, named MACS, which stands for Markov chain-based Approximation of CCN Caching Systems, can be extended to represent an interconnection of caches under different schemes. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of our model, we proposed to derive the two most effective techniques in the literature, namely LCD and LRU-K, which may adapt to changing patterns of access. Simulation results using a discrete event simulator clearly show the accuracy of the proposed model under different network configurations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a power management strategy (PMS) for an integrated residential solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage unit (ESU) is proposed for both grid-connected and islanded operations to take the advantage of time-of-use pricing. This is an effective solution to integrate storage and renewable energy sources, such as solar PV, with the conventional grid to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power system and to reduce the total electricity cost for the consumer. An automatic switching control strategy is proposed to realize a smooth switching among the various operation modes of the proposed energy management strategy. The integrated PV-storage system is composed of a 5-kW PV array, a 3.5-kW·h ESU formed by 12-V single lead acid batteries, and three power converters. The PMS ensures seamless switching of the ESU converter between the charging and the discharging mode and seamless switching between the inverting and the rectifying mode of the grid converter. It also ensures that the local loads are supplied when the grid fails. An experimental setup has been implemented in the laboratory using the real-time field-programmable gate array general-purpose inverter control card from National Instrument to verify the practical feasibility of the proposed PMS under the various scenarios of the PV irradiation, load changings, and the state of charge of the ESU. The results show that the proposed PMS is effective and robust against various scenarios.},

Qualified studies can quantify adverse impacts of high PV penetration on distribution networks and assist utilities in decision making. This paper proposes an index-based methodology for assessing the impact of high solar PV generation, considering the reverse power flow and voltage rise phenomena. Indices are defined that link these two phenomena and their impact on the voltage profile across the feeder. This assessment relies on detailed modeling of the network and the solar PV generation components, which are performed over a 24-h window. Results are presented for a modified 13-bus IEEE test network, emulating a weak network with three-phase balanced loads. This methodology can only be applied to three-phase balanced networks. Actual insolation levels and load profiles are used to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed indices. This paper derives the acceptable range of the proposed indices and safe margin, which have been compared with the basic active power curtailment method with no constraint, in order to avoid voltage rise. The IEEE 69-bus network is also modified and assessed for voltage rise due to reverse power flow and compared before and after applying the proposed methodology.},

The effect of using PV inverters with voltage regulation is simulated. Results show that some minor overvoltage problems can be expected in the future, particularly in urban areas.

	abstract = {Owing to the intermittent characteristic of solar radiation, power system reliability may be affected with high photovoltaic (PV) power penetration. To reduce large variation of PV power, additional system balancing reserve would be needed. In deregulated power systems, deployment of reserves and customer reliability requirements are correlated with energy and reserve prices. Therefore a new method should be developed to evaluate the impacts of PV power on customer reliability and system reserve deployment in the new environment. In this study, a method based on the pseudo-sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique has been proposed to evaluate the reserve deployment and customers' nodal reliability with high PV power penetration. The proposed method can effectively model the chronological aspects and stochastic characteristics of PV power and system operation with high computation efficiency. An auto-regressive and moving average model has also been developed for simulating the chronological characteristics of the solar radiation. Customers' reliability preferences have been considered in the generation and reserve deployment. Moreover, the correlation between PV power and load has been considered in the proposed method. Nodal reliability indices and reserve deployment have been evaluated by applying the proposed method to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers reliability test system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

	abstract = {The interest in self-consumption of electricity generated by rooftop photovoltaic systems has grown in recent years, fueled by decreasing levelized costs of electricity and feed-in tariffs as well as increasing end customer electricity prices in the residential sector. This also fostered research on grid-connected PV-battery storage systems, which are a promising technology to increase self-consumption. In this paper a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV-battery system that minimizes the total discounted operating and investment costs is developed. The model is employed to study the effect of the temporal resolution of electrical load and PV generation profiles on the rate of self-consumption and the optimal sizing of PV and PV-battery systems. In contrast to previous studies high resolution (10 s) measured input data for both PV generation and electrical load profiles is used for the analysis. The data was obtained by smart meter measurements in 25 different households in Germany. It is shown that the temporal resolution of load profiles is more critical for the accuracy of the determination of self-consumption rates than the resolution of the PV generation. For PV-systems without additional storage accurate results can be obtained by using 15 min solar irradiation data. The required accuracy for the electrical load profiles depends strongly on the load profile characteristics. While good results can be obtained with 60 s for all electrical load profiles, 15 min data can still be sufficient for load profiles that do not exhibit most of their electricity consumption at power levels above 2 kW. For PV-battery systems the influence of the temporal resolution on the rate of self-consumption becomes less distinct. Depending on the load profile, temporal resolutions between 5 min and 60 min yield good results. For optimal sizing of the PV power and the storage capacity a resolution of 60 min is found to be sufficient. For the sizing of the battery inverter power of the storage system, a finer temporal resolution of at least 300 s is necessary.},

	abstract = {Due to the development of renewable energy sources (RESs), maximization of hosting capacity (HC) of RESs has gained significant interest in the existing and future power systems. HC maximization should be performed considering various technical constraints like power flow equations, limits on the distribution feeders' voltages and currents, as well as economic constraints such as the cost of energy procurement from the upstream network and power generation by RESs. RESs are volatile and uncertain in nature. Thus, it is necessary to handle their inherent uncertainties in the HC maximization problem. Wind power is now the fastest growing RESs around the world. Hence, in this paper a stochastic multi-objective optimization model is proposed to maximize the distribution network's HC for wind power and minimize the energy procurement costs in a wind integrated power system. The following objective functions are considered: 1) Cost of the purchased energy from upstream network (to be minimized) and 2) Operation and maintenance cost of wind farms. The proposed model is examined on a standard radial 69 bus distribution feeder and a practical 152 bus distribution system. The numerical results substantiate that the proposed model is an effective tool for distribution network operators (DNOs) to consider both technical and economic aspects of distribution network's HC for RESs.},

These problems occur when the system exceeds its hosting capacity (HC) limit. The HC is a transactive approach that provides a way for the distribution network to be integrated with different types of energy systems. Accordingly, HC assessment and enhancements become an essential target for both distribution system operators and DG investors. This paper provides, for the first time, a systematic and extensive overview of the HC research, developments, assessment techniques and enhancement technologies. The paper consists of four HC principal sections: historical developments, performance limits, perceptions and enhancement techniques. Besides, practical experiences of system operators, energy markets and outcomes gained from real case studies are presented and discussed.

To obtain a detailed result of the rooftop PV hosting capacity, the customer with rooftop PV is randomly selected one by one. The proposed method is performed with over/undervoltage, substation power factor and reverse power flow limit. The comparative study is provided to investigate the impacts of the operational limits on the rooftop PV hosting capacity. Since the load demand and PV output vary with the time, the analyses are conducted in a time-series framework. In this work, constant PQ of loads is assigned, and all rooftop PV systems are assumed to have unity power factor. The results show that the substation power factor limit is more restrictive compared to overvoltage limit and reverse power flow limit. The substation power factor limits the rooftop PV penetration on feeder F1, feeder F2, and feeder F3, respectively, 86.52\%, 79.37\%, and 85.85\% faster than reverse power flow limit. The results also indicate that the substation power factor decreases with the increasing of rooftop PV penetration.},

We explore long-term scenarios for capacity expansion of the Java-Bali electricity system in Indonesia, considering the country's renewable energy targets. We apply the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model with an integration of technological learning. Our results reveal that, at the medium and high pace of technological learning, the total costs of electricity production to achieve the long-term renewable energy target are 4–10\% lower than the scenario without considering technological learning. With respect to technology, solar PV and wind become competitive with other types of renewables and nuclear. Moreover, the fulfilment of the renewable energy targets decreases CO2 emissions by 25\% compared to the reference scenario. Implications of our results indicate that energy policies should focus on the early deployment of renewables, upgrading the grid capacity to accommodate variable renewable energy, and enabling faster local learning.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an original non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation tool is developed. This tool permits to compute the optimal dispatch of classical (coal, oil, etc.) thermal generation in order to minimize polluting gases (NO x, CO 2, etc.) emissions in presence of wind power and under constraints. These constraints include, e.g., the maximal generation cost or the ability of the electrical system to cover the load, ... In comparison with existing analytical tools that are based on restrictive hypotheses when it comes to wind power modelling (generally represented by a single entirely correlated global wind park), unexpected outages of conventional parks or fluctuating representation of the load, the use of Monte Carlo simulation allows to remove all those limitations. Indeed, thanks to the developed tool, the optimal dispatch of classical thermal generation can be reached under several load conditions. Well-known reliability indices can also be computed and, moreover, following the wind speed sampling that is used, entirely correlated, independent or more accurate correlation level between wind parks can be considered. Finally, it is thought that the proposed solution can be a useful tool for electrical system operators in order to dispatch the polluting thermal units under cost, reliability, emissions, fluctuating wind power and unexpected outages constraints. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Interconnection procedures and the various tools and techniques used to evaluate interconnection requests (applications) vary from utility to utility. Standardized interconnection and permitting procedures were developed in California before most other states began focusing on these topics. But today many states and utilities have standardized interconnection procedures, building on either the California model, set by Rule 21, or the federal model, the Small Generator Interconnection Procedures (SGIP) created by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These procedures have been put in place to ensure that safety, reliability, and power quality are maintained throughout the grid. These interconnection rules have clearly benefited the PV industry, as can be seen by the gigawatts of distribution-connected PV systems installed throughout the U.S. However, most PV stakeholders agree that interconnection can be improved by streamlining the entire process from application to installation. To examine opportunities for such streamlined processes, this report summarizes interviews held with 19 electric utilities regarding their interconnection procedures. The utilities are located in the state of California and in the southwestern, central, and northeastern regions of the US. It is important to note that many of the utilities that have been interviewed have worked diligently over the past few years to improve their interconnection processes, thereby reducing the costs and the total time from application to installation. This report identifies practices that might be considered by any utility, particularly those that are positioning themselves for new PV interconnection applications and installations.},

The program focuses on research to improve the utility application review and approval process for interconnecting distributed energy resources such as solar to the distribution system. The CSI3 program is supporting EPRI, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in their collaboration on the process with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG\&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG\&E). At present, the application review and approval process is the most time-consuming of any step on the path to generating power for delivery through the distribution system. Completed CSI3 project tasks include data collection from the three utilities, clustering of feeder characteristic data, detailed modeling of 16 feeders, and analysis of photovoltaic (PV) impacts on those feeders. The distributed PV impacts are being examined to determine gaps and limitations in the current California Rule 21screening process. Updates to Rule 21 supplemental review will also identify when higher levels of PV could be accommodated without initiating the detailed review process. The majority of these updates to the supplemental review originate directly from results of the detailed study. The updates will provide utilities with additional guidance on the information/data and equations needed to better determine the impact from aggregate levels of PV on a feeder. This report highlights the modeling, analysis, and results from the evaluation of PV impacts on the 16 feeders. A subsequent report will discuss suggested modifications to the current screening process and provide validation with additional feeder models developed under the CPUC CSI3 initiative.},

	abstract = {Distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation has begun to impact distribution systems. The impact is unique to individual distribution feeders and is based on certain or all issues ranging from voltage, loading, power quality, protection, and control. The impact distributed PV will have on a specific distribution feeder can only be determined with knowledge of that feeder's characteristics. These characteristics include but are not limited to load, voltage, regulation, and impedance. This Technical Update discusses the analysis developed by EPRI to determine distributed PV impact to a specific feeder. The analysis uses a stochastic approach when creating potential PV deployment scenarios. The stochastic nature of the analysis takes into account the uncertainty in the size and location of potentially installed PV systems. Through the examination of issues for thousands of potential scenarios, the feeder impact is used to determine the total amount of PV that is likely to cause an adverse impact to the feeder. This amount of PV is considered the feeder's hosting capacity, or in other words, the maximum amount of PV that can be accommodated. The feeder modeling, analysis, and evaluation of issues to determine hosting capacity are all discussed in detail in this report.},

In particular, distribution network operators are now facing reduced and even reversed power flows at times of high PV generation and low load. This has a range of impacts of including, notably, voltage rise in the network. Existing planning tools are not necessarily appropriate in this changing context. This paper presents a novel method for simply and easily estimating the maximum PV generation that can be integrated into low voltage feeders while avoiding excessive voltage levels. This exercise would generally require the use of power flow analysis software. The proposed method, however, provides maximum PV generation estimates that are close to those calculated by such tools while being easily implemented in standard spreadsheet software. The method can therefore simplify the task of distribution network operators in planning and operating their networks when facing growing PV penetrations on their low voltage feeders.},

This goal is boosting the installation of renewable energy resources (RES), as well as a major consumer engagement that seeks for a more efficient utilization of these resources toward the figure of 'prosumers'. Nevertheless, these resources present an intermittent nature, which requires the presence of an energy storage system and an energy management system (EMS) to ensure an uninterrupted power supply. Moreover, network-related issues might arise due to the increasing power of renewable resources installed in the grid, the storage systems also being capable of contributing to the network stability. However, to assess these future scenarios and test the control strategies, a simulation system is needed. The aim of this paper is to analyze the interaction between residential consumers with high penetration of PV generation and distributed storage and the grid by means of a high temporal resolution simulation scenario based on a stochastic residential load model and PV production records. Results of the model are presented for different PV power rates and storage capacities, as well as a two-level charging strategy as a mechanism for increasing the hosting capacity (HC) of the network.},

This claims for the deployment of control strategies to deal with these concerns, especially those related to overvoltage issues. Based on this, this paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the performance of PV inverters operating with droop control for overvoltage mitigation using a stochastic methodology based on a Monte Carlo approach. The uncertainty related to the PV generation and the users' consumption behavior is fully considered through advanced statistical modeling techniques. Voltage magnitude and loading indexes are used as key metrics to assess the technical performance of the distribution network, simulated using OpenDSS, under two droop-based control strategies: Active Power Control (APC) and coordinated Reactive and Active Power Control (RPC-APC). The effects of curtailed energy on the PV users' revenue is also analyzed. A case of study based on real smart meter data from The Netherlands is used. According to the obtained results, both control strategies are effective to mitigate voltage violations. Nevertheless, for the case of 100\% PV penetration, the droop-based coordinated RPC-APC allowed an 18\% more of exported energy than the droop-based APC control strategy.},

Results show that it is possible to perform a risk-based analysis of hosting capacity by means of a lognormal distribution. Furthermore, overvoltage is found to be the most restrictive impact of PV integration; such information can help to guide utility actions to avoid technical violations. Extensive sensitivity studies are also presented to quantify the effects of several factors on the PV hosting capacity. The effects of number of customers with PV generators, PV power factor, voltage magnitude on the medium-voltage system, load level, and conductor impedances are investigated. It is also shown that the hosting capacity for the entire utility can be estimated by performing simulations only on 1\% of the circuits randomly selected.

It is a cost-based multiobjective optimization strategy that considers two primary factors: 1) distribution system cost; and 2) battery cycling cost. Quantitative analyses on the benefits and tradeoffs of BESS installations are carried out considering different service options. BESS is investigated for three main service options: 1) voltage regulation; 2) loss reduction; and 3) peak reduction. The performance and benefits of the optimized BESS to control one service option exclusively or multiple services simultaneously is compared. The analysis is further extended to study the effect of installation site on the size, management strategy, and the service option. Results show that optimal integration of BESSs can realize maximum operational and cost benefits while effectively elevating the load and DG hosting capability of the network. The approach is developed using MATLAB interior-point algorithm.

The necessary disaggregation models were constructed using the quasi-universal hourly atmospheric transmittance kt, instead of the irradiation itself, as the random variable. Analyses of meteorological records revealed that both the marginal probability and stochastic features of sets of hourly events kt within an individual day can be closely predicted using the Kt for the day. Results indicated that the parameters defining the disaggregation procedure were independent of geographical location. The values of kt are found to be closely modeled by a Beta distribution, and a mean correlation coefficient between successive hourly values of kt was found to be 0.54±0.14. An algorithm is described from which unlimited hourly solar irradiation data may, therefore, be generated using only the 12 monthly means of daily events, Kt. © 1990.},

In most cases, the locations and sizes of the PV are not known in advance, so hosting capacity must be considered as a random variable. Most hosting capacity methods study the problem considering a large number of scenarios, many of which provide little additional information. We overcome this problem by studying only cases where voltage constraints are active, with results illustrating a reduction in the number of scenarios required by an order of magnitude. A linear power flow model is utilised for this task, showing excellent performance. The hosting capacity is finally studied as a function of the number of generators connected, demonstrating that assumptions about the penetration level will have a large impact on the conclusions drawn for a given network.},

The solution can effectively be used in screening new interconnection requests as well as to estimate how much and where PV can be located such that grid upgrades are minimized. The method is being implemented in commercial distribution system analysis tools where it can be applied system-wide or on individual feeders. The streamlined analysis of an individual feeder would take in the order of minutes compared to hours for a detailed analysis. Application of the results include improved screening tools, visualization of hosting capacity constrained feeders, and identification of problematic locations within a feeder.

	abstract = {Many countries have experienced a surge in the level of the penetration of solar PV systems in the last decade. A huge portion of the newly deployed PV systems are connected to low voltage Grid. High Penetration of PVs at this level could potentially disrupt the normal operation of distribution network. A major concern is the impact of these units on power quality indices. Namely, photovoltaic panels could increase the level of voltage and current unbalance, deteriorate harmonic distortion and cause the voltage rise. These concerns may prohibit higher pentation levels of PVs. Thus, proper assessment techniques are vital for network operators for the planning and decision-making process. On the other hand, many characteristics of PV system are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties should be properly modeled in assessment framework. The main effort of research communities is to propose new methodologies that could model the uncertainty of solar power generation and stochastic assessment methods that could accurately estimate the state of the operation of the network with different levels of penetration of solar photovoltaics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent publications and trend of research activities regarding methods of representing uncertain variables and stochastic assessment techniques for power system quality analysis.},

This study compares an evaluation of the conscious and subconscious attitudinal, control and normative beliefs of American homeowners when randomly primed with two brochures depicting the purchasing, installation, and commissioning of solar PV systems, developed according to the characteristics of conventional and an adhesive “plug and play” BAPV system. The survey instrument (N = 400 survey participants) was designed in consonance to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). When comparing the direct measures for each solar PV technology, no significant differences were found. This may indicate that for those unfamiliar with PV technology, placing an adhesive backing module on the roof is standard procedure and does not impact purchasing intentions. The evaluation further showed that unlike the subconscious control beliefs, social norms and attitudes have a significant impact on forming intentions to adopt solar PV. The implications of these findings for strategy, policy and future research are explored.},

A methodology for the optimum sizing of photovoltaic-battery system for remote electrification incorporating the uncertainty associated with solar insolation is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on the design space approach involving a time series simulation of the entire system. The design space approach was originally proposed for sizing of the system with deterministic resource and demand. In the present paper, chance constrained programming approach has been utilized for incorporating the resource uncertainty in the system sizing and the concept of design space is extended to incorporate resource uncertainty. The set of all feasible design configurations is represented by a sizing curve. The sizing curve for a given confidence level, connects the combinations of the photovoltaic array ratings and the corresponding minimum battery capacities capable of meeting the specified load, plotted on an array rating vs. battery capacity diagram.The methodology is validated using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach with illustrative examples. It is shown that for the case of constant coefficient of variation of solar insolation, the set of sizing curves for different confidence levels may be represented by a generalized curve. Selection of optimum system configuration for different reliability levels based on the minimum cost of energy is also presented. The effect of ambient temperature on sizing a stand-alone photovoltaic-battery system is also illustrated through a representative example. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) in power systems poses many research challenges. Research shows that the RES output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Consequently, the direction of the power flow on distribution lines can be reversed during some periods. As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder. Therefore, most utilities try to set a penetration level (PL) limit for safe operation. On the other hand, time varying and unbalanced loading are the main characteristics of distribution systems. Moreover installation of intermittent and nondispatchable photovoltaic (PV) devices increases the control problems of distribution system. This paper presents an impedance-based monitoring method for detection of distribution system current behavior. It will be shown that by utilizing this monitoring technique, not only the small variation of PV PL can be easily detected, but also some fast transients such as the effect of cloud movement on PV system can be monitored. This monitoring technique employs only local measurements of bus voltages and line current to measure the apparent impedance seen at the installation point. The practical application of measured impedance as a monitoring technique shows its effectiveness for distribution system monitoring in presence of various PV PL.},

Higher DG penetration levels may be interesting from many different points of view, but raise important issues about distribution system operation. Therefore, new techniques are needed to determine the maximum amount of DG that may be installed without requiring major changes in the existing electric power system. According to the literature, voltage rises at load bus bars are a serious limiting factor when installing DG. This paper presents and discusses studies proving that conductor ampacity and voltage rises are limiting factors that manifest themselves under different conditions. The present study highlights situations in which line overloads are more restrictive than voltage rises. Variation in substation voltage, load, and its power factor were simulated in a simplified radial distribution system model, and the amount of distributed generation that may be installed was obtained. Mathematic formulae were developed to determine the amount of distributed generation for existing utility systems.},

In our method, the uncertain DG outputs and load demands are formulated as stochastic variables following some ambiguous distributions. In addition to the given expectations and variances, the polyhedral uncertainty intervals are employed for the construction of the probability distribution set to restrict possible distributions. Then, we decide the optimal sizes and locations of DG to maximize the total DG hosting capacity under the worst-case probability distributions among this set. Since more information is utilized, our proposed model is expected to be less conservative than the robust optimization method and the traditional distributionally robust method. Using the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) reformulation technique and strong duality, we transform the proposed model into an equivalent bilinear matrix inequality problem, and a sequential convex optimization algorithm is applied for solution. Our model guarantees that the probability of security constraints being violated will not exceed a given risk threshold. Besides, the predefined risk level can be tuned to control the conservativeness of our model in a physically meaningful way. The effectiveness and robustness of this proposed method are demonstrated numerically on the two modified IEEE test systems.},

Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

The majority of already-installed PV systems are decentralized units that are usually connected to low-voltage (LV) distribution grids. The PV hosting capacity of an LV grid is usually limited by overvoltage, and the efficient control of distributed electrical energy storage systems (EESSs) can considerably increase this capacity. In this paper, a new control approach based on the voltage sensitivity analysis is proposed to prevent overvoltage and increase the PV hosting capacity of LV grids by determining dynamic set points for EESS management. The method has the effectiveness of central control methods and can effectively decrease the energy storage required for overvoltage prevention, yet it eliminates the need for a broadband and fast communication. The net power injected into the grid and the amount of reactive power absorbed by PV inverters are estimated using the PV generation forecast and load consumption forecast, and the dynamic operating points for energy storage management are determined for a specific period of time by solving a linear optimization problem. Simulations performed on a realistic LV feeder of the Danish island Bornholm verify the performance of the proposed method.},

The stochastic nature of PVDG and loads were considered in the study using probabilistic techniques. The impact of PVDG on the number of tap changes of the voltage regulators was investigated. The tests results in a real life large scale distribution network demonstrated that the PVDG can cause around 31\% of improvements in the voltage conformity indices. This impact is less beneficial than the one associated with the connection of conventional distributed generation due to the variability in the primary energy resource. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the connection of PVDG increases the lifespan of the voltage regulators as a result of a reduction about 20\% in the number of tap changes.},

	abstract = {Since on-grid rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installation is rapidly growing, and the interconnection requests of a new rooftop PV installation are still increasing, the improvement of PV hosting capacity of large-scale rooftop PV penetration needs to be studied. In this paper, the strategy to improve PV hosting capacity using reactive power control of PV inverters is provided. Since the load demand and PV output vary with the time, the results are provided in time-series. Monte Carlo based method is constructed to model the random nature of PV penetration concerning PV size and location. Furthermore, an evaluation study is provided to obtain the appropriate PV power factor setting of which the PV hosting capacities are the highest. Firstly, several possible settings of PV power factor are constructed to conduct an evaluation study of reactive power control scenarios. Secondly, the best setting is chosen concerning the ability for generating the highest PV hosting capacity. In addition, a case study is provided to assess the best setting presented by the evaluation study. The results show that rooftop PV penetration with lagging power factor setting of PV inverters generates higher PV hosting capacity compared to rooftop PV penetration with unity power factor setting, with an improvement rate of 96\%.},

	abstract = {Without appropriate counteraction, the high amount of installed distributed generators (DG) at the low-voltage distribution level may cause overloading of electrical equipments and violation of voltage limits in many grids. Because of the historically grown low-voltage grids and their local and geographic dependencies, complex grid structures can be found. Thus, the discrimination of grids concerning their DG capacity is a difficult task. We propose a novel three-step classification strategy to distinguish various kinds of low-voltage grids regarding their DG capacity. Our method is based on a stochastic simulation procedure and a subsequent parametric stochastic modeling, which allows for a probability based classification approach. The classification results can be regarded as probabilistic class memberships or, if sharp memberships are required, the class with the maximum probability can be selected. The proposed approach will not only help distribution system operators to face the challenges in future grid planning and focus their work on further enhancement of weak grid structures, but it will also be valuable in choosing relevant grids for detailed surveys. To demonstrate that our approach actually leads to meaningful classification results for real low-voltage grids, we empirically evaluate the results for 300 real rural and suburban grids by comparing them to classification assessments of experts from distribution grid planning practice.},

In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

This generally occurs when the generation from PV resources substantially exceeds the load demand during high insolation period. This paper has investigated the solar PV impacts and developed a mitigation strategy by an effective use of distributed energy storage systems integrated with solar PV units in LV networks. The storage is used to consume surplus solar PV power locally during PV peak, and the stored energy is utilized in the evening for the peak-load support. A charging/discharging control strategy is developed taking into account the current state of charge (SoC) of the storage and the intended length of charging/discharging period to effectively utilize the available capacity of the storage. The proposed strategy can also mitigate the impact of sudden changes in PV output, due to unstable weather conditions, by putting the storage into a short-term discharge mode. The charging rate is adjusted dynamically to recover the charge drained during the short-term discharge to ensure that the level of SoC is as close to the desired SoC as possible. A comprehensive battery model is used to capture the realistic behavior of the distributed energy storage units in a distribution feeder. The proposed PV impact mitigation strategy is tested on a practical distribution network in Australia and validated through simulations. © 2013 IEEE.},

In particular, the introduction of photovoltaic (PV) generation at the low voltage (LV) level has highlighted the ongoing need for more extensive and detailed modeling to quantify the full extent and nature of potential impacts. While a number of approaches have been developed to address the size of this problem, the most accurate and comprehensive approach is to carry out simulations for the entire network across multiple scenarios. However, this task is computationally complex and requires significant amounts of data. To address this challenge, this paper presents a simplified and computationally efficient methodology based around a two-bus equivalent model, which may be used to estimate the maximum voltage in an LV area due to PV generation over time. The developed model is validated against a full three-phase power flow approach for a real-world distribution network comprising 10 213 LV network areas. Furthermore, to highlight its utility, the model is used in a case study examining the effectiveness of reactive power injection for mitigating overvoltage due to PV generation.},

It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment.

Since 2009, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and industry partners have been working to establish a common set of functions that can provide such capability. The development of a common set of functions is complete; however, very little work to date has addressed the impact that these common functions will have on grid performance, especially at the distribution level. At the same time, EPRI has established a method that uses model analysis and simulation for determining the PV hosting capacity of distribution feeders. This project combines these two efforts to provide a better understanding of the impact of grid supportive inverters on distribution feeders through hosting capacity. This report summarizes the analysis that determines the additional amount of PV that distribution feeders can accommodate with the use of smart inverters. The analysis in this report focuses on the impact of three different functions—power factor, volt-var, volt-watt—on four feeders in the United States.},

	abstract = {A methodology to generate hourly series of global irradiation is proposed. The only input parameter which is required is the monthly mean value of daily global irradiation, which is available for most locations. The procedure to obtain new series is based on the use of a multiplicative autoregressive moving-average statistical model for time series with regular and seasonal components. The multiplicative nature of this models enables us to capture the two types of relationships observed in recorded hourly series of global irradiation: on the one hand, the relationship between the value at one hour and the value at the previous hour and on the other hand, the relationship between the value at one hour in one day and the value at the same hour in the previous day. In this paper the main drawback which arises when using these models to generate new series is solved: namely, the need for available recorded series in order to obtain the three parameters contained in the statistical ARMA model which is proposed (autoregressive coefficient, moving-average coefficient and variance of the error term). Specifically, expressions which enable estimation of these parameters using only monthly mean values of daily global irradiation are proposed in this paper.},

To facilitate the effective coordination of sequential (Q−V and P−V) droop control of PV inverters, multiple control areas with the strong coupling nature of PV systems are identified based on the ϵ-decomposition technique. The droop control parameters are tuned and adapted, based on a consensus among PV inverters within each control area. This proposed control strategy inherits the autonomous feature of the droop control for coping with voltage rise issues while being able to avoid curtailing a significant amount of PV production. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, simulations using MATLAB/Simulink are performed on a real European LV distribution network, considering a PV penetration level of about 150\%. The obtained results highlight that the proposed control strategy successfully mitigates voltage rise problems while significantly reducing the amount of curtailed PV generation by approximately 35.6\% and 76.2\% when compared with the static sequential droop control and the static Q−V droop control and adaptive P−V droop control, respectively. Simultaneously, the effective contribution among all the PV systems towards voltage rise mitigation is obtained.},

	abstract = {Connections of distributed generation (DG) systems to distribution networks are increasing in number, though they may often be associated with the need of costly grid reinforcements or new control issues to maintain optimal operation. Appropriate analysis tools are required to check distribution networks operating conditions in the evolving scenario. Load flow (LF) calculations are typically needed to assess the allowed DG penetration level for a given network in order to ensure, for example, that voltage and current limits are not exceeded. The present paper deals with the solution of the LF problem in distribution networks with photovoltaic (PV) DG. Suitable models for prediction of the active power produced by PV DG units and the power absorbed by the loads are to be used to represent the uncertainty of solar energy availability and loads variation. The proposed models have been incorporated in a radial distribution probabilistic load flow (PLF) program that has been developed by using Monte Carlo techniques. The developed program allows probabilistic predictions of power flows at the various sections of distribution feeders and voltage profiles at all nodes of a network. After presenting theoretical concepts and software implementation, a practical case is also discussed to show the application of the study in order to assess the maximum PV peak power that can be installed into a distribution network without violating voltage and current constraints. A comparison between Deterministic Load Flow (DLF) and PLF analyses is also performed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An interval time series (ITS) is a time series where each period is described by an interval. In finance, ITS can describe the temporal evolution of the high and low prices of an asset throughout time. These price intervals are related to the concept of volatility and are worth considering in order to place buy or sell orders. This article reviews two approaches to forecast ITS. On the one hand, the first approach consists of using univariate or multivariate forecasting methods. The possible cointegrating relation between the high and low values is analyzed for multivariate models and the equivalence of the VAR models is shown for the minimum and the maximum time series, as well as for the center and radius time series. On the other hand, the second approach adapts classic forecasting methods to deal with ITS using interval arithmetic. These methods include exponential smoothing, the k-NN algorithm and the multilayer perceptron. The performance of these approaches is studied in two financial ITS. As a result, evidences of the predictability of the ITS are found, especially in the interval range. This fact opens a new path in volatility forecasting.},

Since the output power of these systems highly depends on weather conditions that can change during a day, their increased level of penetration may have significant effects on residential low voltage distribution networks (residential networks). The objective of this paper is to study the effects of different penetration levels of these hybrid systems on daily voltage profile, voltage fluctuation and voltage imbalance of balanced and unbalanced residential networks during different seasons of a year. In order to model uncertainties of daily active and reactive power consumption by residential homes and also daily PV and WT system output power during different seasons with 1-min resolution, our study used the ARIMA simulator in the MATLAB R2013b software environment. The evaluations in this paper are focused on voltage behavior in a standard balanced and unbalanced three-phase four-wire low voltage residential network with the results providing valuable information and data for universities and industry working to advance the fast growth of these hybrid systems. Some key findings are as follows: (1) The increased penetration level of the hybrid system leads to decreased voltage violation of the acceptable limit. (2) Tap-changer operation prevents more voltage drop, and the system voltage drop exceeds acceptable limits for a few minutes. (3) In unbalanced conditions, the LV distribution transformer must be equipped with an automatic tap-changer. (4) Unique seasonal distribution functions of active and reactive power, solar and wind system power have been developed using 1-min system performance modeling.},

Several control techniques are developed to address over-voltage problem using Deterministic Load Flow (DLF). However, intermittent characteristics of PV generation require Probabilistic Load Flow (PLF) to introduce variability in analysis that is ignored in DLF. The traditional PLF techniques are not suitable for distribution systems and suffer from several drawbacks such as computational burden (Monte Carlo, Conventional convolution), sensitive accuracy with the complexity of system (point estimation method), requirement of necessary linearization (multi-linear simulation) and convergence problem (Gram-Charlier expansion, Cornish Fisher expansion). In this research, Latin Hypercube Sampling with Cholesky Decomposition (LHS-CD) is used to quantify the over-voltage issues with and without the voltage control algorithm in the distribution network with active generation. LHS technique is verified with a test network and real system from an Australian distribution network service provider.

	abstract = {High levels of penetration of distributed photovoltaic generators can cause serious overvoltage issues, especially during periods of high power generation and light loads. There have been many solutions proposed to mitigate the voltage problems, some of them using battery energy storage systems (BESS) at the PV generation sites. In addition to their ability to absorb extra power during the light load periods, BESS can also supply additional power under high load conditions. However, their capacity may not be sufficient to allow charging every time when power absorption is desired. Therefore, typical PV/BESS may not fully prevent over-voltage problems in power distribution grids. This work develops a cooperative state of charge control scheme to alleviate the BESS capacity problem through Monte Carlo tree search based reinforcement learning (MCTS-RL). The proposed intelligent method coordinates the distributed batteries from other regions to provide voltage regulation in a distribution network. Furthermore, the energy optimization process during the day hours and the simultaneous state of charge control are achieved using model predictive control (MPC). The proposed approach is demonstrated on two test cases, the IEEE 33 bus system and a practical medium size distribution system in Alberta Canada.},

	abstract = {With the growing use of renewable energy sources, Distributed Generation (DG) systems are rapidly spreading. Embedding DG to the distribution network may be costly due to the grid reinforcements and control adjustments required in order to maintain the electrical network reliability. Deterministic load flow calculations are usually employed to assess the allowed DG penetration in a distribution network in order to ensure that current or voltage limits are not exceeded. However, these calculations may overlook the risk of limit violations due to uncertainties in the operating conditions of the networks. To overcome this limitation, related to both injection and demand profiles, the present paper addresses the problem of DG penetration with a Monte Carlo technique that accounts for the intrinsic variability of electric power consumption. The power absorbed by each load of a medium voltage network is characterized by a load variation curve; a probabilistic load flow is then used for computing the maximum DG power that can be connected to each bus without determining a violation of electric constraints. A distribution network is studied and a comparison is provided between the results of the deterministic load flow and probabilistic load flow analyses.},

	abstract = {The main objective of network planning is to determine the technically and economically optimal solution that will ensure continuity of supply and adequate power quality as well as allow further integration of distributed generation (DG), despite its substantial impact on the network performance. The maximum DG penetration level also has to be planned or at least assessed, and is heavily dependent on the DG location and size and on the voltage control method. The paper presents a probabilistic approach to network planning, which has many advantages compared to the traditional approaches using estimated peak values and empirically defined simultaneity factors. The method enables the evaluation of the future voltage conditions and therefore the comparison of different network development scenarios, taking into account the stochastic natures of future DG location and loads consumption. By analyzing different solutions, it is possible to minimize the necessary investments in the network. The planning method is presented on an actual low-voltage (LV) distribution network, but it can be used also in medium-voltage (MV) network planning as well. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	title = {Theory and {Algorithms} for {Hidden} {Markov} {Models} and {Generalized} {Hidden} {Markov} {Models}},
	abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used in pattern recognition applications, most notably speech recognition. However, they have been studied primarily on a practical level, with the HMM matrices as the fundamental objects and without considering the viewpoint of an observer trying to accurately predict the future output. This dissertation is a study of the processes represented by HMMs using the concepts and techniques of stochastic automata derived from the study of dynamical systems and their complexity. The goal is to understand these processes in the language of stochastic automata. Along the way, certain ideas of stochastic automata are characterized in a measure-theoretic manner. We begin by defining a process to be a stationary measure space of bi-infinite sequences. We define a process state to be a conditional distribution on the future of a process which corresponds to the state of knowledge held by an observer who has seen some or all of the process's history. This definition is similar in spirit to ideas used in dynamical systems, and it is a formalization of the notion of a "deterministic state" used in automata theory. We describe the process states of HMM processes. And we give a necessary condition for a process to have an HMM representation. Following [Balasubramanian] and [Ito et al], we define Generalized Hidden Markov Models (GHMMs). These are structurally and operationally the same as HMMs, except that parameters which are interpreted as probabilities in defining HMMs are allowed to be negative in GHMMs. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions for two GHMMs (and thus two HMMs) to represent the same process, and and we give a method for finding the smallest possible GHMM equivalent to a given one. Going further, we give an algorithm for constructing a GHMM that represents a process from the probabilities that process assigns to words. We prove that, for every process, either the algorithm constructs a GHMM that represents the given process or that no such representation exists. This characterizes the set of process representable by GHMMs. Finally, we describe an implementation of this algorithm which constructs GHMMs from sample sequences.},
