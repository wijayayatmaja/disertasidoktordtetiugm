abstract = {To minimize line losses of power systems, it is crucially important to define the size and location of local generation to be placed. On account of some inherent features of distribution systems, such as radial structure, large number of nodes, a wide range of X/R ratios; the conventional techniques developed for the transmission systems generally fail on the determination of optimum size and location of distributed generations. In this study, a loss sensitivity factor, based on the equivalent current injection, is formulated for the distribution systems. The formulated sensitivity factor is employed for the determination of the optimum size and location of distributed generation so as to minimize total power losses by an analytical method without use of admittance matrix, inverse of admittance matrix or Jacobian matrix. It is shown that, the proposed method is in close agreement with the classical grid search algorithm based on successive load flows. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Often PV hosting capacity analysis is performed for a limited number of distribution feeders. For medium - voltage distribution feeders, previous results generally analyze less than 20 feeders, and then the results are extrapolated out to similar types of feeders. Previous hosting capacity research has often focused on determining a single value for the hosting capacity for the entire feeder, whereas this research expands previous hosting capacity work to investigate all the regions of the feeder that may allow many different hosting capacity values wit h an idea called locational hosting capacity (LHC)to determine the largest PV size that can be interconnected at different locations (buses) on the study feeders. This report discusses novel methods for analyzing PV interconnections with advanced simulati on methods. The focus is feeder and location - specific impacts of PV that determine the locational PV hosting capacity. Feeder PV impact signature are used to more precisely determine the local maximum hosting capacity of individual areas of the feeder. T he feeder signature provides improved interconnection screening with certain zones that show the risk of impact to the distribution feeder from PV interconnections.},

The proposed fast maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms can produce extremely variable loading of the power semiconductors resulting in a decrease of the system lifetime, which in consequence can nullify the economic advantage of higher energy harvesting. This work analyzes the problem with a deep theoretical and laboratory work. Then, a multiobjective MPPT, which limits the positive temperature gradient and the maximum junction temperature of the power semiconductors, is introduced and fully validated in the laboratory with a mission profile emulating variable irradiance conditions.},

abstract = {The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) in power systems poses many research challenges. Research shows that the RES output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Consequently, the direction of the power flow on distribution lines can be reversed during some periods. As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder. Therefore, most utilities try to set a penetration level (PL) limit for safe operation. On the other hand, time varying and unbalanced loading are the main characteristics of distribution systems. Moreover installation of intermittent and nondispatchable photovoltaic (PV) devices increases the control problems of distribution system. This paper presents an impedance-based monitoring method for detection of distribution system current behavior. It will be shown that by utilizing this monitoring technique, not only the small variation of PV PL can be easily detected, but also some fast transients such as the effect of cloud movement on PV system can be monitored. This monitoring technique employs only local measurements of bus voltages and line current to measure the apparent impedance seen at the installation point. The practical application of measured impedance as a monitoring technique shows its effectiveness for distribution system monitoring in presence of various PV PL.},

abstract = {The proliferation of photovoltaic (PV) generation in low-And medium-voltage distribution networks is expected to continue. Qualified studies can quantify adverse impacts of high PV penetration on distribution networks and assist utilities in decision making. This paper proposes an index-based methodology for assessing the impact of high solar PV generation, considering the reverse power flow and voltage rise phenomena. Indices are defined that link these two phenomena and their impact on the voltage profile across the feeder. This assessment relies on detailed modeling of the network and the solar PV generation components, which are performed over a 24-h window. Results are presented for a modified 13-bus IEEE test network, emulating a weak network with three-phase balanced loads. This methodology can only be applied to three-phase balanced networks. Actual insolation levels and load profiles are used to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed indices. This paper derives the acceptable range of the proposed indices and safe margin, which have been compared with the basic active power curtailment method with no constraint, in order to avoid voltage rise. The IEEE 69-bus network is also modified and assessed for voltage rise due to reverse power flow and compared before and after applying the proposed methodology.},

@article{Breker2015,
abstract = {Without appropriate counteraction, the high amount of installed distributed generators (DG) at the low-voltage distribution level may cause overloading of electrical equipments and violation of voltage limits in many grids. Because of the historically grown low-voltage grids and their local and geographic dependencies, complex grid structures can be found. Thus, the discrimination of grids concerning their DG capacity is a difficult task. We propose a novel three-step classification strategy to distinguish various kinds of low-voltage grids regarding their DG capacity. Our method is based on a stochastic simulation procedure and a subsequent parametric stochastic modeling, which allows for a probability based classification approach. The classification results can be regarded as probabilistic class memberships or, if sharp memberships are required, the class with the maximum probability can be selected. The proposed approach will not only help distribution system operators to face the challenges in future grid planning and focus their work on further enhancement of weak grid structures, but it will also be valuable in choosing relevant grids for detailed surveys. To demonstrate that our approach actually leads to meaningful classification results for real low-voltage grids, we empirically evaluate the results for 300 real rural and suburban grids by comparing them to classification assessments of experts from distribution grid planning practice.},

@article{Beck2016,
abstract = {The interest in self-consumption of electricity generated by rooftop photovoltaic systems has grown in recent years, fueled by decreasing levelized costs of electricity and feed-in tariffs as well as increasing end customer electricity prices in the residential sector. This also fostered research on grid-connected PV-battery storage systems, which are a promising technology to increase self-consumption. In this paper a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV-battery system that minimizes the total discounted operating and investment costs is developed. The model is employed to study the effect of the temporal resolution of electrical load and PV generation profiles on the rate of self-consumption and the optimal sizing of PV and PV-battery systems. In contrast to previous studies high resolution (10 s) measured input data for both PV generation and electrical load profiles is used for the analysis. The data was obtained by smart meter measurements in 25 different households in Germany. It is shown that the temporal resolution of load profiles is more critical for the accuracy of the determination of self-consumption rates than the resolution of the PV generation. For PV-systems without additional storage accurate results can be obtained by using 15 min solar irradiation data. The required accuracy for the electrical load profiles depends strongly on the load profile characteristics. While good results can be obtained with 60 s for all electrical load profiles, 15 min data can still be sufficient for load profiles that do not exhibit most of their electricity consumption at power levels above 2 kW. For PV-battery systems the influence of the temporal resolution on the rate of self-consumption becomes less distinct. Depending on the load profile, temporal resolutions between 5 min and 60 min yield good results. For optimal sizing of the PV power and the storage capacity a resolution of 60 min is found to be sufficient. For the sizing of the battery inverter power of the storage system, a finer temporal resolution of at least 300 s is necessary.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems presents significant impacts on distribution network (DN) operations. To this end, an accurate evaluation of PV hosting capacity (PVHC) can help utilities to carry out PV capacity planning and configuration more effectively, ensuring the efficiency, economy, and reliability of DNs. First, the definition of interval overvoltage probability (IOP) is introduced and the IOP based PVHC evaluation method is presented. Next, this method is improved considering PV and load uncertainties, where the interval arithmetic (IA) and affine arithmetic (AA) are both applied to deal with uncertainties. In addition, the overvoltage severity is taken into account on the basis of IOP, and the concept of interval overvoltage risk (IOR) is proposed. A practical 55-bus rural feeder in China is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method compared with the conventional method, and also to verify the value in decision-making of PV planning for utilities. Moreover, the sensitivity of interval valued PVHC against the number of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and width of PV installation capacity interval (PICI) is analyzed. And the impacts of on-load tap changer (OLTC) tap positions and static var compensator (SVC) configurations are also explored. Finally, the proposed method is tested on the NYSEG 292-bus system to validate its adaptability on a larger and unbalanced system.},

Previous researches have mainly utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that need dramatic computational efforts and may lead to local-optima. Through an extensive circuit analysis new terms called “Diff and Pivot” are proposed based on analytical formulations. The diff value represents the difference between the maximum loss reduction caused by a DG placed at a bus and the previous bus. Pivot relates diff values at every two successive branches. An algorithm named Pivot for Simultaneous Reconfiguration and DG Hosting (PSRH) is developed. For verification, PSRH is applied to IEEE-33, IEEE-69, and practical 84-bus RDNs and results are compared to AI techniques. Deduced outcomes are very encouraging with fewer computational steps. Moreover, the compromised solution of PSRH is superior when considering the outages of DGs as PV modules at night.},

abstract = {Unmanaged high penetration of customer-scale photovoltaic on the distribution network results in voltage rises along the network. However, the performance of the implemented battery energy storage system (BESS) to prevent voltage rise under that high penetration condition was unclear because the previous penetration models did not consider the intermittency and variability characteristics of the penetration due to their model simplifications. Therefore, this research proposes a BESS control scheme to mitigate impermissible voltage rises by considering the penetration characteristics of intermittency and variability. As a result, the proposed model outperformed the previous model by providing a more complete representation of the actual penetration issues, and thus the expected contribution of the BESS control scheme in reducing voltage rises could be provided.},
