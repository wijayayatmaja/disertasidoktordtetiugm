Abstract is written in English Language. The penetration of solar power plants in low-voltage distribution has become a major topic in the world of renewable energy. This research discusses the potential of solar energy and the benefits of photovoltaic (PV) in low-voltage distribution. The research also discusses the technology used to install PV in low-voltage distribution and its impact on the power system. The results show that PV can efficiently generate electricity and can help increase the availability of electricity in areas that are difficult to reach by the main power distribution network. However, to maximize the benefits of PV, careful planning and investment are needed. This research can serve as a reference for governments and industry players in developing renewable energy and achieving lower carbon emission targets.
